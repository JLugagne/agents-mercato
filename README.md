# mct — A package manager for AI coding agents, skills, commands, and hooks

Think **npm**, but for the agents, skills, slash commands, and Claude Code hooks consumed by Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, OpenCode, pi, Kilo, Factory, Qwen, Kiro, Windsurf, and more.

Install, share, version, and sync agent, skill, command, and hook definitions across your team, your machines, your CI — and across **multiple AI tools at once** — from any Git repository.

## The problem

Agents and skills are becoming a critical part of how teams build software. They define how your AI reviews code, writes tests, refactors, enforces conventions.

But right now, they are:

- scattered across personal `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`, `.codex/`… directories
- copy-pasted between projects, teammates, and tools
- duplicated and rewritten for each AI tool you use
- drifting silently when someone edits a file locally
- impossible to discover or reuse across teams
- never in sync between your laptop and CI

Agents and skills are code-adjacent artifacts. They deserve the same tooling as code: versioning, dependencies, distribution, reproducibility — and a single source of truth across tools.

That's what `mct` does.

## The solution

`mct` treats Git repositories as **markets** — sources of agent, skill, command, and hook definitions — and installs them into your project. Each entry is **transformed** at install time into the native format of every AI tool you've enabled (or, for hooks, merged into `.claude/settings.json`).

- **Markets** are Git repos you register as sources
- **Entries** (agents, skills, slash commands, Claude Code hooks) are installed from markets
- **Transformers** convert each entry into the correct format and location for every enabled tool (Claude plus 22 other tools, see [Supported tools](#supported-tools))
- **Dependencies** between skills are resolved automatically
- **Drift detection** knows when you've modified an installed file locally
- **Sync** pulls upstream updates and flags conflicts
- **Search** works across all your markets, fully offline
- **Save / Restore** makes your whole setup portable in one file
- **Git hooks** keep your team's setup in sync automatically

No central registry. No server. Just Git.

## Quick example

Register a market and install an agent:

```bash
mct market add team git@github.com:my-org/claude-agents.git
mct add team@profile/agents/reviewer
```

Refs use the `market@path` form: the part before `@` is the market name you registered, the part after is the file path inside the repo.

By default, the entry is installed for Claude Code (`.claude/`). Enable other tools to install it everywhere at once:

```bash
mct config set tools.codex true
mct config set tools.opencode true
mct add team@profile/agents/reviewer
# Writes .claude/agents/reviewer.md
#        .codex/agents/reviewer.toml
#        .opencode/agents/reviewer.md
```

Save your setup so the rest of the team (and your CI) can reproduce it:

```bash
mct save
git add .mct.json
git commit -m "add mct setup"
git push
```

Restore on another machine:

```bash
git pull
mct restore
```

Use in CI:

```yaml
- name: Restore agents and skills
  run: mct restore

- name: Run Claude with restored skills
  run: claude -p "Review this PR" --skills ./.claude/skills
```

Your agents and skills are consistent everywhere — every laptop, every tool, every CI runner.

## Features

Real features, all implemented today:

- **Multi-tool installation** — write agents, skills, commands and hooks to 23 AI coding tools from a single source
- **Transformers** — entries are converted to each tool's native format (frontmatter, file extension, directory layout) at install time
- **Tool mappings** — translate models (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) and built-in tool names (`Bash`, `Read`, `Edit`…) to each target tool's equivalent. Editable in `~/.config/mct/toolmappings.yml` for power users
- **Atomic install / update / remove** — every write goes through a per-package staging directory and is promoted in one commit. A crash mid-install never leaves a half-written tree, and a startup recovery pass replays leftover stages from previous crashed runs
- **Dependency resolution** — skills can declare `requires_skills`, and `mct` installs the full graph. Cross-market deps auto-register the foreign market (with a confirmation prompt outside CI mode), and cycles are detected
- **Drift detection** — xxhash checksums detect local edits to installed files, so updates never silently overwrite your work. Locally-deleted files are flagged separately (`StateLocallyDeleted`) so `sync` can offer to restore them
- **Self-healing sync** — `mct sync` prunes stale install locations and upstream-removed files automatically, then offers to **restore any locally-deleted file** interactively (`[r]/[k]/[a]/[n]` per file; `--restore-all` / `--restore-none` flags; CI mode skips silently)
- **Doctor** — `mct doctor` runs a 100% offline read-only audit and surfaces every issue (modified files, locally-deleted, stale locations, upstream-removed, orphaned packages) in one shot, with `--json` for CI
- **Conflict handling** — filename collisions across markets, version mismatches on shared deps, and hook `(event, matcher)` collisions are surfaced via `mct conflicts`
- **Offline BM25 search** with fuzzy matching, across all registered markets
- **Interactive TUI** for browsing markets and managing installations
- **Prune** to handle entries deleted upstream — keep locally or remove, tracked via tombstones
- **Lint** — validate a market repo's structure before publishing (`mct lint`)
- **SSH support** for private repositories (system SSH agent, `~/.ssh/config`, `known_hosts`)
- **JSON output** (`--json`) on most commands for scripting and CI
- **Save / Restore** to a portable `.mct.json` file — share setups across machines and teammates. First run with no config auto-initializes the project
- **Project-level overrides** — a project `.mct.json` can enable a different subset of tools than your global config; the two are merged at install time
- **Git hooks** — `mct hook install post-pull` and `mct hook install pre-push` keep `.mct.json` and the local install in sync automatically
- **Cross-process safe** — the install database uses cross-platform file locking, so two `mct` processes can't corrupt each other's state
- **Self-update** — `mct dist-upgrade` updates the binary; a daily background check notifies you of new releases
- **Tracking metadata** injected into frontmatter (`mct_ref`, `mct_version`, `mct_market`, `mct_installed_at`, `mct_checksum`) so installed files are self-describing

## Install

**Linux / macOS (recommended):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JLugagne/agents-mercato/main/install.sh | bash
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin/mct` (no root required). Override with `MCT_INSTALL_DIR=/your/path` or pin a version with `MCT_VERSION=v1.3.9`.

**Go install:**

```bash
go install github.com/JLugagne/agents-mercato/cmd/mct@latest
```

**Self-update:**

```bash
mct dist-upgrade
```

## Supported tools

Entries are authored once in Claude Code format and converted for every enabled tool that is detected in the project (its marker directory, e.g. `.codex/`, exists). "shared" means `.agents/skills/<name>/`, the cross-tool skills directory, written once for all tools that read it. "native" means the tool already reads the Claude Code files, so nothing extra is written.

| Tool | Skills | Agents | Commands | Hooks |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `claude` | `.claude/skills/` | `.claude/agents/` | `.claude/commands/` | `.claude/settings.json` |
| `codex` | shared | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | — | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| `cursor` | native | native | skill in `.cursor/skills/` | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| `copilot` | native | native | skill in `.github/skills/` | `.github/hooks/mct-*.json` |
| `gemini` | shared | `.gemini/agents/` | `.gemini/commands/*.toml` | `.gemini/settings.json` |
| `opencode` | native | `.opencode/agents/` | `.opencode/commands/` | plugin `.opencode/plugins/mct-*.ts` |
| `pi` | shared | — | `.pi/prompts/` | extension `.pi/extensions/mct-*.ts` |
| `kilo` | `.kilo/skills/` | `.kilo/agents/` | `.kilo/commands/` | plugin `.kilo/plugin/mct-*.ts` |
| `factory` | shared | `.factory/droids/` | `.factory/commands/` | `.factory/hooks.json` |
| `qwen` | `.qwen/skills/` | `.qwen/agents/` | `.qwen/commands/` | `.qwen/settings.json` |
| `kiro` | `.kiro/skills/` | `.kiro/agents/` | skill in `.kiro/skills/` | `.kiro/hooks/mct-*.json` |
| `windsurf` (Devin Desktop) | shared | — | `.devin/` or `.windsurf/workflows/` | `.devin/` or `.windsurf/hooks.json` |
| `junie` | shared | `.junie/agents/` | `.junie/commands/` | — |
| `vibe` (Mistral) | shared | `.vibe/agents/*.toml` | skill in `.vibe/skills/` | — |
| `antigravity` | shared | — | skill in `.agents/skills/` | `.agents/hooks.json` |

| `codewhale` (ex DeepSeek-TUI) | native | `.codewhale/agents/*.toml` | — | — |
| `zed` | shared | — | — | — |
| `trae` | `.trae/skills/` | — | — | — |
| `roocode`, `continue` (legacy) | one rule file per skill | — | — | — |

Amp, Crush and Goose read `.claude/skills/` natively and need no target.

Only `claude` is enabled by default. Enable others with `mct config set tools.<name> true` (unknown names are rejected). Model and tool names in agents are mapped per tool; override them in `~/.config/mct/tool-mappings.yml`.

Hooks are merged into each tool's settings or hooks file without touching user-authored entries: mct records the exact entry it added so it can update or remove it later. For OpenCode, Kilo and pi, each hook becomes a small TypeScript plugin that runs the hook command and blocks the tool call when it exits with code 2.

Files written by older mct versions (previous tool formats, removed tools, legacy hook entries) are converted automatically by `mct update` / `mct sync`, or explicitly with `mct migrate [--dry-run] [--all-locations]`. Locally modified files are never overwritten.

## Core commands

```bash

```

See `mct --help` for the full command list, including `lint`, `conflicts`, `index`, `readme`, and more.

## Why not just use Git?

Git gives you versioned files. It doesn't give you:

- **Multi-tool fan-out** — write the same source entry to Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, pi and more with one command, each in the right format and location
- **Dependency resolution** — when installing a skill, its required skills come along automatically
- **Drift detection** — Git can't tell you that you edited `code-reviewer.md` locally after installing it from a market, and that the upstream has also changed
- **Multi-repo composition** — using agents from three different repos in one project, with consistent updates
- **Offline search across sources** — BM25 + fuzzy, no network calls, no data leaving your machine
- **Reproducible CI** — a single `.mct.json` that pins your markets and installed entries for the whole team

`mct` is built on top of Git. It just makes Git usable for a use case Git wasn't designed for.

## Use cases

**Team workflows** — share reviewers, conventions, and skills across a team via a single private Git repo.

**Mixed-tool teams** — one developer uses Claude Code, another uses Cursor, a third uses Windsurf. Author skills once in a market, install them everywhere with the same `.mct.json`.

**CI automation** — pin your setup in `.mct.json`, run `mct restore` in CI, get reproducible AI-assisted pipelines regardless of which tool runs.

**Multi-machine setups** — keep your personal config in sync across laptop, desktop, and remote dev boxes.

**Enterprise environments** — SSH support and fully local search mean internal agents and skills can be shared without any data leaving the company network.

## Creating a market

A market is just a Git repository with a specific layout. See [MARKET.md](./MARKET.md) for the full spec, examples, and details on tool transformations.

## Roadmap

- Public and private registries
- Semantic versioning and compatibility checks
- Signed entries
- Richer conflict resolution UI in the TUI
- More tool targets as the ecosystem grows

## Scope

`mct` writes a **single source-of-truth entry** (Markdown + YAML frontmatter, the format established by the Claude Code ecosystem) into the **native format of every AI coding tool** you use. The goal is to make agents and skills truly portable across the AI tooling landscape, instead of forcing teams to maintain N copies of the same prompt for N tools.

If your tool isn't supported yet, transformers are small and self-contained — contributions welcome.

## Feedback

Open questions I'd love input on:

- How should conflicts between multiple markets exposing the same entry be handled?
- What belongs in a future `mct` standard vs. what should stay market-specific?
- What's missing for your team or your tool to adopt it?

Issues and discussions welcome.
